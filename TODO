General
--------
- Använd inte BG/FG Chunk.
- Använd uint64 med alpha för pixlar.
- Set 1 LSB to 1 if pixel is used.
- Fixa dynamiskt antal chunks så det skapas allt eftersom man addar pixels.

- MAP:
    - read bg
    - read layers
    - parrallax layers

    - bg, fg, actual map

- New Game must initialize everything correctly (now player is not hurt)
- Remove minimap?
- Position life correctly
    
- Scale of everything should be affected by fullscreen/resolution
    -> Right now everything is scaled differently in fullscreen.
