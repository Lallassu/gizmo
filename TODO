General
--------
- Pixel density (as in urho3d?)

- Reduce the entity-interface?
    - Just have Draw()?
        -> The rest should be a different interface?

    - effects such as smoke
        -> map.go with Draw() function
    - Configurable map generation vars

- Special-effects
    -> Lightning
    -> Shaders

- Performance issues?
    -> AI loads high?
    -> Enemy physics?
    -> triangle count?

- AI
    - Follow player
    - Walk speed/run speed
    - "think-bubbles"
        - Spotted
    - Pickup weapons if seen

- Sound effect when go through doors

- Configuration support
    - Json file -> struct
    - Add fullscreen support
